# python-challenge

This is the Read Me for the Python HW called python-challenge

During this assignment I have created 2 python scripts for two different csv's.
The first assignment can be found in the "PyBank" directory."

the script is named "main.py", which reads the csv from the Resources directory.
This script loops through the csv to find the Total amount of months, total profit/loss, the average change amount, and the max and min changes.

The script then outputs a txt file into the "analysis" directory

The second assignment can be found in the "PyPoll" directory.
the script is named "main.py", which reads the csv from the Resources directory.
The script loops through the csv, adding the votes up for each canidate, and then declares a winner.
The analysis is then exported to a txt file into the "analysis" directory
